Assuming ms(i,j) is the maximum score that Alex can get, where the remaining piles are piles[i], piles[i+1], …, piles[j]. Recursive function can be obtained from ms(i,j) in terms of ms(i+1,j) and ms(i,j-1). Dynamic programming helps to not repeat work in this recursion. When we have the previously mentioned remaining piles, each player has only two options. 
When Alex is playing, the options are piles[i] and piles[j], the score will be increased by this amount. Therefore total score could be piles[i]+ms(i+1,j) or piles[j]+ms(i,j-1). We are looking for the maxim possible score. When Lee is playing, the options are piles[i] and piles[j], the score will decrease by this amount. Therefore total score could be –piles[i]+mw(i+1,j) or –piles[j]+ms(I,j-1). We are looking for the minimum score.
I am planning to use a 2D array that will store the different scores depending on the decisions that the players take in their turns. This will help avoid the computation of operations that have been solved already
